            <h1>Physicist! Teacher! Software Engineer! Greek!</h1>
            <p>It is widely believed that modern workers will need to change multiple careers during their working lives. Being a scientist I had to validate the hypothesis by experiment, and since no one I knew seemed to be prepared to volunteer to be my test subject that left me with only one option: I would be my own guinea pig! So a few years ago I set out to start a new career and see how things would go, for science of course!</p>
              <!-- <br> -->
            <p>My background was a Bsc in Physics from the University of Crete. My first profesional steps where tutor of Physics and Mathematics working as a freelancer and in collaboration with various tutoring centers in Heraclion and Athens in Greece. In paralel however I had always been involved with compluters as a hobby and when time came to switch careers this interest allong with my good mathematical background from my diploma made the IT field an easy choise.</p>
            <p>After some failed starts trying to find a part time master's cource that would not clash with my working schedule I found the perfect match in the Hellenic Open University. Three years lots of coffee and long nights later I was armed with an M.Sc. in Information Science, knowledge of Software Design and Management Processing, basic coding skills as well data mining methods and tools from my Thesis. With these I started testing the hypothesis that someone would actually pay me to apply these new skills in practice.</p>
            <p>Predictably the opportunity presented itself in a manner consistent with murphy's law. The job I found ( and have to this day ) in data integration put none of my fledgling skills in data mining, python and C to use and required a completely new set presenting a new and steep learning curve. Familiarising myself with a new set of middleware frameworks and tools as well as new languages on the job was often hectic and always stressful but after a year of working in the field I am now confident in my abilities.</p>
            <p>While it's far too early to tell if my experiment will be sucessfull ,one year is hardly a career after all, it seems to be going well. I will ofcourse continue to toil away in the service of science and hope that my sacrifices will one say be recognized.</p>
